[How to execute the player for existing System 2 data:]

Running non-contact measurement with System 2 generates a CSV file.  This player is created to replay the process with this set of CSV data.

The embedded system is run in a hardware box called i.MX8.  Power on i.MX8.
Connect to i.MX8 through a serial cable.
Through Tera Term (5) or puTTY, open a terminal.
In the terminal, login as user: root, no password.  All commands are issued as dot+space+command.

Type ". startEmulation.sh" and hit ENTER to start the RESTful server and to start the emulator.
Type ". startEmulation.sh defaultCu3V70s.csv" and hit ENTER to start the RESTful server and to start the emulator with the file defaultCu3V70s.csv.
Type ". self_test.sh" and hit ENTER to perform self-test.
Type ". stopEmulation.sh" and hit ENTER to stop the RESTful server and to stop the emulator.

Access the server through the following ways:
1. Browser with URL http://172.16.14.16:4000 plus the requested meta data sub-URL. Synopsis follows in self-test.
2. Linux/Unix/iOS terminal: type "curl http://172.16.14.16:4000 plus the request data meta data sub-URL.  Synopsis follows in self-test.
3. For individual test item execution using a browser, taking Tj as an illustration, type "http://172.14.16.61:4000/get_temperature?channel=Tj" in the browser.
4. For individual test item execution using a terminal, taking Tj as an illustration, type "curl http://172.14.16.61:4000/get_temperature?channel=Tj" in the terminal.

Demonstration commands:
Type ". startEmulation.sh" in one terminal.
Type ". self_test.sh" in another terminal.
Type ". stopEmulation.sh" in any of the terminals.

Additional commands:
cd -- change directory
ls -al -- list current directory.
